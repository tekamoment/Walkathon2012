			<h1> What we do: </h1>
			<p> </p>
			<p> Each year our student Charities team surveys all students to find out the kinds of charities where they would like their funds to go. Once this has been done the team researches specific charities and finds projects that fit their criteria. After contacting the charities and meeting them the team makes a final decision on which charities we will support in the coming Walkathon.  </p>
			<p> <strong> The 2012 Charities have been selected! Read on to find out more. </strong> </p>

		<h1> 2012 Charities </h1>
		</div>
		
		<p> Students on the charity committee at AIS Kemang and Pejaten brainstormed types of charities
 that they could support and then surveyed all students at the school. The students voted to
 support charities that work with orphans and street children as well as children from
 disadvantaged families. Students and teachers researched charities with advice from ANZA and
 parents and friends involved in charities in the Jakarta area.</p>
		
		<h2> Yayasan Sahabat Anak </h2>
		<p> We picked <strong> Yayasan Sahabat Anak </strong> as a common charity for AIS Kemang and Pejaten to support.
 Sahabat Anak is a non-profit organisation that provides quality education and children’s rights
 advocacy in an effort to encourage and inspire Jakarta’s street children to escape urban
 poverty. In English Sahabat Anak means a child's friend. As the name suggests it is through
 friendship with children that we fight for their basic rights. Volunteers in this organisation
 invest their time, energy and resources into helping children access their right to education and
 a life free of poverty, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity or social class.</p>

 		<h2> Remaja Masa Depan Foundation </h2>
 		<p> The other charity the committee decided to support is the <strong> Remaja Masa Depan (RMD)
 Foundation </strong>. This charity runs an orphanage and junior high school for street children and
 disadvantaged children. RMD Foundation is an Indonesian civil society organization whose
 principal purpose is to advocate and empower vulnerable children. It works toward the
 liberation of the child from the suffering caused by working on the street, dropping out of
 school, and living with no families, no parents, and no home. Its beneficiaries are not only
 children, but also their families.</p>

 		<h2> Yayasan Kampung Kids </h2>
 		<p> Money raised by the Australian International School from Walkthon 2009 has been sponsoring
4 students from <strong> Kampung Kids </strong> to complete their elementary and junior high school education.
Rara Azahra, A. Kahfi Ridho, Anisa Fitriah and M.Ibnu Khadafi have shown excellent academic
results and they are eager to continue their study in high school to fulfill their dream to change
their underprivileged lives. Unfortunately, the fund used to support them will run out in early
 2013.
The 2012 Australian International School walkathon can help them reach their dream to go on
and finish high school and hopefully escape poverty when they grow up. The money from this
year’s walkathon will pay for these students to complete their high school education.</p>

		<h2> Kids Working on Dumpsites in Jakarta </h2>
		<p> As part of the English unit for Year 7, students are reading a book about kids who work in
 dumpsites called ‘Trash’. They will also be learning about children in similar situations in
 Jakarta and researching ways in which they can effectively support these communities to
 improve their lives. Towards the end of the term students will be visiting a dumpsite in North
 Jakarta where children work and go to school. We would like to bring them gifts of food,
 clothing and equipment that is badly needed for their school.</p>
 
 		<h2> Service Learning and Global Citizens</h2>
 		<p> Students will initiate and run their own projects to improve the community and the
 environment. Some small grants will be awarded to assist the students to set up these projects.</p>

		<h2> YKAKI </h2>
		<p> Care for Cancer Kids Indonesian Foundation -  was established to support children with cancer and their parents. The story began when two mothers in Indonesia (Mrs. Ira and Mrs. Pinta) had  sons  that were diagnosed with leukemia. At that time the best treatment for them was in the Netherlands. Both families moved away from Jakarta to Netherlands for treatment. During treatment the families were able to stay at a "Ronald McDonald House", which provides free temporary housing for children with cancer and the parents.  The boys were also provided an education during their treatment.  On their return to Indonesia, after their sons' treatments were completed, they founded YKAKI in Jakarta, based upon their experience in the Netherlands. YKAKI is committed to helping children with cancer, especially those whose families are economically challenged. YKAKI provides free temporary housing for the children and their parents while they are in Jakarta for treatment.  They also provide education for the children. </p>

		<h2> Rumah Yatim </h2> 
		<p> Rumah Yatim is an organisation which aims to support orphans and disadvantaged children to have brighter future.  They offer accommodation and educational opportunities.  They have a branch in Kemang, Jakarta and additional hostels all over Indonesia.</p>
		<p> Find out more about Rumah Yatim <strong><a href="http://www.rumah-yatim.org">here</a></strong>.</p>
		
		<h2> Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOS)</h2>
		<p> Hundreds of orphaned orangutans have been rescued from the perils that killed their mothers; but in the absence of a parent, each of the rescued orangutan must learn how to survive on their own before they can be released back into the wild. BOS Foundation´s reintroduction programs aim to teach these orphans their basic skills while caring for them around the clock.</p>
		<p> We have lent a hand and taken part in the mission by adopting two orangutans Lomon and Kesi. This way, we have been able to contribute to the cost of feeding and looking after them.  Additional money was used to re-plant trees in Kalimantan in our name.</p>
		<p> Find out more about the BOS <strong><a href="http://orangutan.or.id/home">here</a></strong>. </p>
		
		<h2> Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN) </h2>
		<p> JAAN is a non-governmental, non-profit organization established in January 2008 to help protect Indonesian wildlife and to improve the welfare of Jakarta’s domestic animals. JAAN serves as an information center and a central meeting point for volunteers interested in animal welfare issues and enlists the help of individuals and Indonesian authorities to rescue animals from exploitation and to decrease the trade in endangered wildlife. JAAN aims to raise awareness of animal welfare issues by providing educational materials and presentations in and around Jakarta.</p>
		<p> In 2009 and 2010 we supported JAAN by funding repairs to their raptor cage in the Thousand Islands and completing the Islands project. </p>
		<p> Find out more about the JAAN <strong><a href="http://jakartaanimalaid.com/">here</a></strong>. </p>
		
		<h2>Yayasan Berita Sehat </h2>
		<p> Yayasan Belita Sehat, the Indonesian branch of The Foundation for Mother and Child Health (FMCH) works to improve the lives of mothers and children in local communities by providing programmes focused on health, nutrition, education, and sustainable skills training. A not-for-profit independent organization, they work with socially and/or financially disadvantaged communities regardless of their race, creed or gender. </p>
		<p> Activities in Jakarta include health, hygiene and nutrition education for mothers and community health workers; access to medical care for both mothers and children; Early Childhood learning, supplementary feeding programmes and growth monitoring for young children; and skills training for mothers. Our charities team went on a big shopping spree to buy stationary, toiletries, cleaning materials, classroom activity packs and books as well as spending the remaining money providing teacher training for their staff. Many of our Y12 students carried out work experience placements with this organization and so were able to see where our money had been well spent. </p>

		<h2> Yayasan Kampung Kids </h2>
		<h3> From a letter dated in 2009: </h3>
		
		
		<h4> "Dear AIS families and staff, </h4>
		<p> With money raised from the 2009 walkathon the Australian International School (AIS) has been sponsoring 4 students from Kampung Kids to complete their elementary school education. They are Rara Azahra, A. Kahfi Ridho, Anisa Fitriah and M.Ibnu Khadafi. They are now in the sixth grade of elementary school and are getting ready to enter junior high school in July 2011. Their fathers are construction labor workers, while their mothers are housewives. They are really eager to study and have dreams to change their underprivileged lives in the future. </p>
		<p> We hope we can help them to reach their dream and get out of poverty when they grow up.We on behalf of Yayasan Kampung Kids especially these 4 students and families would like to thank you, AIS students and teachers who have put in so much effort to keep them in school. </p>
		<p> Yours sincerely, </p>
		<h4> Julia on behalf of Yayasan Kampung Kids"</h4>

		<h2> Habitat for Humanity Indonesia </h2> 
		<p> Habitat for Humanity Indonesia is not a hand-out program. Volunteers and home partner families are directly involved in building Habitat homes. They are sold to the selected families at no-profit-for-interest terms. Home partner families are chosen not only based on their level of need but also on their ability and willingness to pay the monthly amortization and provide “sweat equity”. As part of their investment, they must render volunteer hours to build their own homes and those of their future neighbors. Our money goes on working here…..as one family pays back the funds another family benefits. </p>
