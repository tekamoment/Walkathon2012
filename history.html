			<h1> The story so far: </h1>
			<p> </p>
			<p> The annual AIS Walkathon is the one single event of the year that brings together staff, students and AIS families from both high school and primary campuses located in Pejaten and Kemang, for a common purpose: to raise funds for the less privileged. </p>
			<p> In 2009, following on an ever-increasing enthusiasm for House events, and successful fundraising activities being run at both Jakarta campuses, Walkathon organisers Jill Batty and Anna Brickle felt that the time was now right for the School's first ever joint-campus event. The AIS Walkathon was born.</p>
			<p> The AIS community was ready to rise to the challenge. Student leaders, with staff to guide them, set about planning and organising the details. The usual sense of sporting rivalry between Houses was replaced by a keen and overwhelming desire to help those less fortunate than ourselves. Posters designed to promote the event went up and the Walkathon logo - a giant foot carried on the shoulders of stick figures in AIS House colours, created by Namitha Ragunath - became an instant hit. </p>
			<p> This event has now become an annual feature; unprecedented numbers of AIS families have turned up at the Walkathon each year to walk, jog, run and even skate laps in the salubrious setting of the Ragunan Zoo. Babies in strollers with mums in Walkathon tee-shirts can be seen doing leisurely laps, side by side with the more serious runners in trainers and running gear. </p>
			<p> Over past years, funds in excess of 300 million rupiah have been raised, which in turn has allowed AIS help numerous charities in Indonesia to carry out their valuable work. AIS is building long standing commitments and relationships with many of those organisations, and will continue to offer them support in the future.</p>
			<p> After the success of our student designed website in 2011 we have another student making an updated version this year. You will be able to register online, and keep up to date with AIS Walkathon 2012 news using the web site.</p>
			<p> With three very successful events now behind us we are looking forward to more records being set, such as maximum laps run and maximum money raised, and of course, even more participants than ever before. </p>
			<p> <strong> We are all very excited about Walkathon 2012. Come join us. We'll see you there! </strong> </p>

		<p> Now in its third year, the AIS charity walkathon is a cross-campus event involving student leaders on both the primary and secondary campuses. Anticipating getting their early bird free-dress passes, students were early to the zoo on the morning of 24th September ready to run, jog and walk to help this year’s charity causes. The weather was great and so 260 students, plus their family and friends, came out to support the event. The Promo team had obviously done a great job with videos and presentations convincing all to join. On the day, our girl scouts were seen handing out stickers to walkers, our entertainment team was on the mike and on bikes screaming encouragement and our registration and website team were ready with everyone’s race bibs. Though tired by the end of four hours, everyone had thoroughly enjoyed themselves, once again with students setting personal bests for the long distances they had walked.  The total of funds raised from 2011 topped IDR 142,000,000. This is a stunning achievement and the money has been put to work to help our nominated charities: Yayasan Kasih Anak Kanker Indonesia, the orphanage Rumah Yatim, and Jakarta Animal Aid Network. </p>

		<p> The second AIS Charity Walkathon took place at Ragunan Zoo on Sunday 26th August 2010. It was drizzling at 5am, but with dawn came some relief in the weather, and by 8am the glorious morning sun shone over 250 students and their families, as well as AIS staff who were walking and running laps in a beautiful and shady corner of the zoo. Many students set and met individual goals, surpassing their achievements of last year and exceeding their own expectations, some walking or running in excess of 20 kilometres. Students also looked fabulous in their navy blue Walkathon T-shirts with the same logo being used from last year, designed by Namitha who is now in Year 5. </p>
		<p> With the help of our sponsors and house and SRC representatives we were able to raise much needed funds for charities the students had chosen: Yayasan Balita Sehat, Jakarta Animal Aid Network and the Borneo Orang-utan Survival Foundation. Each charity received 25 million rupiah. A donation of 12.5 million rupiah was later given by Kemang students to a disaster relief fund and the final 12.5 million will be used to cover the costs of setting up and running Walkathon 2011. It has been a really positive experience to be able to increase our contribution to these very worthy causes in such a fun way.</p>

<!-- The year 2009 -->
		<section id="2009">
		<div class = "page-header">
		<h1> 2009 <small> A small idea, a huge event </small></h1>
		</div>
		<p> The first AIS Charity Walkathon took place at Ragunan Zoo on Saturday 8th August 2009. In the glorious morning sunshine over 250 students and their families, as well as AIS staff, walked and jogged, ran and rollerbladed laps in a beautiful and shady corner of the zoo. Many students, having never taken part in such an event, had no idea of what they were capable and astounded us with their determination to keep going. Some students walked or ran in excess of 20 kilometres. Students also looked fabulous in their Walkathon T-shirts designed by Namitha from Year 4. </p>
		<p> With the help of our Parents and Friends Group and Parent Teacher Group, Ibu Retno, Harley Davidson Group, and the Student Representative Council and House Leaders, as well as all staff on both campuses, we were able to raise much-needed funds for local charities as well as being able to subsidise the cost of printing new House T shirts designed by high school students this year. </p>
		<p>In October Anisa Fitrian, Rara Azzahara, Ibnu Kadavi and Kafi Ridha from Kampung Kids were accompanied to our awards ceremony by Ibu Julia, who heads the organisation. These bright young students received tuition fee for three years of schooling at a cost of 20 million rupiah. </p>
		<p>We also welcomed Ibu Herry Hutahean from Habitat for Humanity. She accepted a gift of 30 million rupiah, which will build a house for a family in Sukakarya help with rebuilding projects in Pangalengan, Bandung following the recent earthquake. </p>
		<p>Also joining us was Ms. Femke from the Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN). Our students have been working with this organisation through our Environmental Club. The 10 million rupiah we gave them will repair a damaged raptor release cage on the Thousand Islands and fund an educational program to help clean up the beaches.</p>
		<p> 10 million had earlier been sent via TRANS TV to help with the Padang earthquake relief effort.</p>
		<p>We would again like to thank every student, parent and staff member who contributed to the success of Walkathon 2009 and feel confident that our four recipients will make good use of the funds. It has been a really positive experience to be able to increase our contribution to these very worthy causes in such a fun way.</p>
