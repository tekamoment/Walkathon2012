			<h1> The story so far: </h1>
			<p> </p>
			<p> The annual AIS Walkathon is the one single event of the year that brings together staff, students and AIS families from both high school and primary campuses located in Pejaten and Kemang, for a common purpose: to raise funds for the less privileged. </p>
			<p> In 2009, following on an ever-increasing enthusiasm for House events, and successful fundraising activities being run at both Jakarta campuses, Walkathon organisers Jill Batty and Anna Brickle felt that the time was now right for the School's first ever joint-campus event. The AIS Walkathon was born.</p>
			<p> The AIS community was ready to rise to the challenge. Student leaders, with staff to guide them, set about planning and organising the details. The usual sense of sporting rivalry between Houses was replaced by a keen and overwhelming desire to help those less fortunate than ourselves. Posters designed to promote the event went up and the Walkathon logo - a giant foot carried on the shoulders of stick figures in AIS House colours, created by Namitha Ragunath - became an instant hit. </p>
			<p> This event has now become an annual feature; unprecedented numbers of AIS families have turned up at the Walkathon each year to walk, jog, run and even skate laps in the salubrious setting of the Ragunan Zoo. Babies in strollers with mums in Walkathon tee-shirts can be seen doing leisurely laps, side by side with the more serious runners in trainers and running gear. </p>
			<p> Over past years, funds in excess of 300 million rupiah have been raised, which in turn has allowed AIS help numerous charities in Indonesia to carry out their valuable work. AIS is building long standing commitments and relationships with many of those organisations, and will continue to offer them support in the future.</p>
			<p> With three very successful events now behind us we are looking forward to more records being set, such as maximum laps run and maximum money raised, and of course, even more participants than ever before. </p>
			<p> <strong> We are all very excited about Walkathon 2012. Come join us. We'll see you there! </strong> </p>
